# Richard Schembri Portfolio Website
A simple Github Pages website that showcases my portolio. Website source is a modified
version of the <a href="https://html5up.net/miniport" target="blank">Miniport</a> template found in html5up.net.
Color palette is taken from https://www.canva.com/colors/color-palettes/summer-splash/
